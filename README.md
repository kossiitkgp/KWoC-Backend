## Development

### Setting Up Locally

- Install [Go](https://go.dev/).
- Clone this repository.
- Run `go mod download` in the cloned repository to download all the dependencies.
- Create a `.env` file to store all the [environment variables](#environment-variables). You can use the `.env.template` file for this.
- Set the `DEV` environment variable to `true`.
- Optionally set up [Github OAuth](#github-oauth) to test the endpoints which require login. (See also: [Endpoints](#endpoints))
- Run `go run cmd/backend.go` to start the server.
- Optionally install [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/) or a similar tool to help manage the local database `devDB.db` (sqlite3).
- Optionally install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or a similar tool to test the API endpoints.
- Optionally (but **recommended**) [set up pre-commit hooks](#setting-up-pre-commit-hooks).

#### Setting Up Pre-Commit Hooks

- Check if `golangci-lint` is installed. If not, install from [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/).
- Run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`, see [core.hooksPath](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-corehooksPath).

### Building

- Install all the dependencies using `go mod tidy` or `go mod download`.
- Run `go build cmd/backend.go` to build the server executable. The executable file will be named `backend`.

### File Naming Convention

See also [File Structure](#file-structure).

1. Test Files: Tests for a particular `file.go` are placed in a file named `file_test.go` and in the same directory.
2. Model Files: Database models are placed in the `models` directory. Each file corresponds to one table in the database, and the name of the file corresponds with the name of the database table.

### Testing

See also [File Naming Convention](#file-naming-convention).

All controllers except `/oauth/` are tested. New controllers should include tests. For controllers, not only successes but failures should also be tested.

The file `controllers/common_test.go` exports functions commonly used in controller tests.

## Project Structure

### Libraries Used

- [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux): Used for routing.
- [gorm.io/gorm](https://gorm.io): Used for database modelling.
- [joho/godotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv): Used for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
- [rs/zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog): Used for logging information, errors, and warnings.

```

- `cmd`: Contains executable files, including the entry point of the server (`backend.go`).
- `controllers`: Contains controllers for the endpoints. (See also [Endpoints](#endpoints))
- `server`: Contains the router logic and routes.
- `models`: Contains KWoC database models.
- `utils`: Contains misc functions like database utils.
- `middleware`: Contains all middleware.

### Endpoints

The documentation for the endpoints can be found [here](https://kossiitkgp.org/KWoC-Backend/).

The endpoints documentation is generated through annotations using the [swagger_docs.yml](./.github/workflows/swagger_docs.yml)
workflow. The generated documentation is saved in the `docs` branch.

For generating the Swagger specification, [swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag) is used, and [redocly](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/) is used to create the visually appealing webpage that is hosted on GitHub Pages.

To customize the rendering of the documentation, you can edit the `docs/redocly.yaml`.

_Please avoid directly pushing to the `docs` branch._

To write annotations for the endpoints, you can refer to [swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag#readme)

_Note:_ For the endpoints which require login with JWT Please include Security annotations like this

```go
// @Security JWT
```

### Middleware

The `middleware/` directory contains all the middleware used in the server. The middleware is used in the `server/routes.go` and `server/router.go` files. The following middleware is exported under the `middleware` package.

All middleware takes an `http.Handler` function as an argument and returns the wrapper `http.Handler` function.

#### Logger

File: `middleware/logger.go`

Logs information regarding the incoming request and the time taken to handle the request.

#### Login

File: `middleware/login.go`

Handles login/authentication for requests. Requests must include the `Bearer` key in the header with the JWT string for login.

The middleware responds to invalid/unauthenticated requests and only passes valid requests to the inner function. The middleware adds the logged-in user's username to the request's context.

A constant `LOGIN_CTX_USERNAME_KEY` exported by the middleware is the key for the login username in the request's context.

```go
login_username := r.Context().Value(middleware.LOGIN_CTX_USERNAME_KEY).(string)
```

#### Wrap

File `middleware/wrap.go`

Adds an instance of the `App` struct (defined in the same file) to the requests' context. This struct contains the database (`*gorm.DB`) used by the server.

A constant `APP_CTX_KEY` exported by the middleware is the key used to access the `App`.

```go
app := r.Context().Value(middleware.APP_CTX_KEY).(*middleware.App)
db := app.Db
```

### Utils

The `utils/` directory contains utility functions reused in multiple controllers. (See also: [File Structure](#file-structure))

#### Database

File: `utils/database.go`

Contains utilities related to database handling.

- `GetDB()`: Connects to the database and returns a `*gorm.DB`.
- `MigrateModels()`: Automigrates database models.

#### JSON

File: `utils/json.go`

Contains utilities for handling of JSON body of request and response.

- `DecodeJSONBody()`: Decodes the JSON body of an HTTP request.
- `RespondWithJson()`: Takes a response struct and responds to with the JSON string of the response with the appropriate headers set.
- `RespondWithHTTPMessage()`: Takes a status code and a message string and responds with the specified status code and message, and JSON-encodes the response.

#### JWT

File: `utils/jwt.go`

Contains utilities for handling [JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](https://jwt.io/).

- `ParseLoginJwtString()`: Parses a JWT string used for login and returns the claims.
- `GenerateLoginJwtString()`: Generates a JWT string used for login using the given claims.

#### Logging

File `utils/log.go`

Contains functions for logging information, warnings, and errors encountered during the handling of an HTTP request in a consistent manner.

- `LogInfo()`: Logs an information message with information regarding the HTTP request that triggered the log.
- `LogWarn()`: Logs a warning with information regarding the HTTP request that triggered the warning.
- `LogWarnAndRespond()`: Logs a warning, same as the `LogWarn()` function, and responds to the HTTP request with the warning message.
- `LogErr()`: Logs an error with an error message and information regarding the HTTP request that triggered the error.
- `LogErrAndRespond()`: Logs an error, same as the `LogErr()` function, and responds to the HTTP request with the error message.

#### OAuth

File: `utils/oauth.go`

Contains functions for authenticating a user via [Github OAuth](#github-oauth). (See also: [Web application flow - Github OAuth Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#web-application-flow))

- `GetOauthAccessToken()`: Gets an access token from the Github API using the given code generated during the authentication process. (See [this](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#2-users-are-redirected-back-to-your-site-by-github) for more information)
- `GetOauthUserInfo()`: Gets basic information about the user from the Github API using an access token. (See: [this](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#3-use-the-access-token-to-access-the-api) for more information)

### Environment Variables

Environment variables can be set using a `.env` (See [Command-Line Arguments](#command-line-arguments) to use a different file) file. The following variables are used. (See the `.env.template` file for an example)

- `DEV`: When set to `true`, uses a local sqlite3 database from a file `devDB.db` (or `DEV_DB_PATH` if set).
- `DEV_DB_PATH`: The path to a local sqlite3 database file to be used in development. (Valid when `DEV` is set to `true`) (Default: `devDB.db`) (NOTE: `testDB.db` is used for testing)
- `BACKEND_PORT`: The port on which the backend server runs. (Default: `8080`)
- `DATABASE_USERNAME`: The username used to log into the database. (Valid when `DEV` is not set to `true`)

- `JWT_VALIDITY_TIME`: The amount of time (in hours) for which the generated JWT tokens should be valid.

### Github OAuth

KWoC uses Github [OAuth](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps#about-github-apps-and-oauth-apps) for authentication instead of passwords.

#### How It Works

KWoC follows the [web application workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#web-application-flow) for authorizing OAuth apps.

1. The [frontend](https://github.com/kossiitkgp/KWoC-Frontend) redirects users to the OAuth login page.
2. The user is redirected to the frontend with a temporary `code`.
3. The frontend makes a request to the `/oauth/` endpoint with the `code`.
4. The backend obtains the user's username, name (if available), and email (if available) from the Github API using the `code`.
5. The backend registers the user in the database and generates a [JWT](https://jwt.io) for authentication.
6. This generated JWT is stored in the local storage by the frontend and sent with the `Bearer` header in subsequent requests to endpoints that require login/registration.

#### Setting Up OAuth

To set up the KWoC server, a Github OAuth application has to be created, and the client id and secret have to be set in the [environment variables](#environment-variables).

- Follow [this](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) documentation to create an OAuth app. Use the `kossiitkgp` organization account in the production server to create the application.
- Set the Homepage URL to `https://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org` and the authorization callback URL to `https://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org/oauth/` in the production application.
- Copy the client ID and the client secret (this should NEVER be made public) and set the `GH_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` [environment variables](#environment-variables) to these values.

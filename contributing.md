# Contributing Guidelines

Hi :wave: there, welcome to KWoC Backend project. We are glad that you considered contributing! Here are a few points that will help you have a great time coding and contributing.

## Guidelines

- We do not commit to `main` branch directly. We open pull requests and merge them in main after review.
- Please comment under the issue you want to work on and wait for it to be assigned to you.

## Contribution Workflow

- Each contribution begins with an issue in this repo.
  - Create the issue as necessary.
- Comment under the issue you want to work on and wait for it to be assigned to you.
- Create a Branch and Commit your changes.
  - Name the branch carefully. For example `feature-card-component`, `bugfix-overlay`. Do not use generic names such as `develop`, `work`, your username etc.
  - Name the commits meaningfully. For help read [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- Check if the solution works by testing it locally.
- Submit a PR with an appropriate name including the term `Fixes #{issue number}` if it fixes that particular issue.
- Be attentive and respond to comments and suggestions in the opened PR.
- We will merge your PR after reviewing and testing it.
